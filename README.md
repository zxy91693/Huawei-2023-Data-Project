## Preprocessing 
The data preprocessing of Huawei 2023 data and also the calculation of popularity

The `popuarity` part is in `main/Preprocessing/Preprocessing.ipynb`
We only use the 2stage time series prediction method. There are many other potential ways to make popularity prediction such as 
1.  RegressionModels: Which can take more stages into consideration (LinearRegression, Lasso, MLP, DecisionTreeRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor)
2.  RNN: Which can make prediction with sequential logic
